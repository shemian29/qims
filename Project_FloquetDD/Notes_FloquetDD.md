# FloquetProject


## Things to consider:

- There are two possible choices of qubits: 
  - The original qubit states, in which case the pulses implement dynamical decoupling. In principle, for this to happen there needs to be a sense in which the 
  - The Floquet eigenstates, in which case the pulses modulate the quasi-energy spectrum


- Noise in the periodic drive that defines the Floquet states could themselves be an issue to consider
- It is possible that the introduction of new sweet spots is equivalent to a partial version of dynamical decoupling 
- -

## Checks:

- The error function does not evaluate discontiuous spectra
- The cut-offs is converged for all figures
- 

## Figures for paper


**Figure 1**: quasi-energy spectrum flattness
- Objective: To illustrate the approach to a flat band in the parameter space
- Quasi-energy as a function of flux for an ideal kick with varying strengths
- Error as a function of a non-ideal pulse strength and width 
  - Need to determine units
  - For a few periods
